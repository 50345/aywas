## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Can I use your code for the AaC feature on Aywas?<br />
**A:** Yes, of course!

**Q:** Can you do a code for my item gallery/pet lair?<br />
**A:** No. Aywas doesn't allow editing like that for item galleries or pet lairs.

**Q:** I want to learn how to code CSS and HTML. Will you teach me?<br />
**A:** No. I really don't have time to teach people CSS and/or HTML from scratch. I recommend that you first poke around on the internet and try to learn by yourself. If you have questions about a specific aspect of coding, then I will do my best to help you.

**Q:** You gave me the code for a link/cursor/image-insertion/etc. Do I have to credit you?<br />
**A:** No. I only require a credit when I've written an entire source code for you. If you just use snippets and scraps, you don't have to credit me.

**Q:** If I move accounts, can I still use the code you wrote?<br />
**A:** Sure, but sometimes the code won't work on another account (especially if you have a shared account code). This is because the element names won't be the same from account to account unless you get super lucky or something. If you move accounts and your code isn't working on the new account, contact me here, and I'll make a new code for you (though nowadays I am trying to make all my codes useable on all profiles no matter what for ease of use).

**Q:** CSS . . . HTML . . . What code is for what kind of page/profile?<br />
**A:** For pet pages, you need both HTML and CSS to make it work. For user profiles, you just need CSS, and for pet profiles, you need CSS and sometimes HTML (in the case of pet profiles, if I've provided both, you must use both for it to work).

**Q:** How do I apply HTML to a pet profile?<br />
**A:** Copy and paste the HTML to the pet description box (located near the top of the page where you edit your pet, below name, title, and gender.

**Q:** How do I find the ID for a custom box on my user profile?<br />
**A:** [Tutorial here](https://github.com/50345/aywas/blob/main/tutorials/finding%20a%20custom%20box%20id.md).
