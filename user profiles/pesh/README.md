This profile is similar to the highlight image theme. Named after a dear friend of mine.

## SETUP

Column 1:
Anything you want!

Column 2:
- Comments panel
- Links panel
- 1 custom panel

Column 3:
Wont' be used 


## EDITING THE CODE

Find the ID of your custom box from column 2 (to do this, go to your profile layout page and then scroll to where you can enter info to the custom boxes; there is a header above the editing space where you can find the ID). 


REPLACE all instances of `#custom-13-panel` with whatever the ID of your custom navigation header box is. (you must do this 2/2 times, located at the bottom of the CSS for ease of editing)

Place a feature image of your choice in the custom panel (in the preview, I used a watercolour texture)!
