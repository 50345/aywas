This is a user profile set up with a basic white background, black navigation header, and multiple pages.

## Profile Details Setup

Column 1:
- Custom box for your navigation header
- Info box
- Links box
- Comments box
- Custom box for your welcome page

Column 2: 
- Anything you want

Column 3:
- Anything you Want

## Navigation Box

This is the setup I had in my navigation box. You can change it up to however you'd like:

`<a href="#">Home</a><a href="#column_2">Synicals</a><a href="#column_3">Pluto</a><a href="http://www.aywas.com/message/compose/0/YOUR-ID-NUMBER-HERE/">Mail</a><a href="http://www.aywas.com/lair/index/YOUR-ID-NUMBER-HERE/">Lair</a><a href="http://www.aywas.com/">Aywas</a>`


## EDITING THE CODE

Find the ID of your custom boxes from column 1 (to do this, go to your profile layout page and then scroll to where you can enter info to the custom boxes; there is a header above the editing space where you can find the ID). 


REPLACE all instances of `#custom-19-panel` with whatever the ID of your custom navigation header box is. (you must do this 5/5 times)

REPLACE all instances of `#custom-40-panel` with whatever the ID of your custom welcome box is. (you must do this 1/1 times)

## OTHER NOTES

Make sure the content for your welcome box is fairly short. If it is longer than the content of your other pages, it will still show in the background.
